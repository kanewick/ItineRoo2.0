# Introduction 
ItineRoo is a ongoing/lately stalled personal project I was working on whilst travelling. The goal of this project was to incorporate all of the things I have learned travelling and all of the things I wanted into one place. I want ItineRoo to become a travel planner/diary that uses third party APIs such as Instagram to load the users images and feed to create a personal type blog.

This projectis currently on hold.

All I have built so far is a DotNet web api using token authentication and made a start on the web app itself.
